# Introduction

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  LX-UI was initially created during the development of the Le-AI project to
  unify the UI style. Later on, it was decided to separate this UI library as it
  proved to be quite good. The goal is to continuously iterate and improve it,
  making it even better over time.

## Basic information

LX-UI is an open-source React UI library based on Radix UI. It utilizes the Tailwind CSS framework and is written in TypeScript, with support for SSR.

Currently, there are many excellent UI libraries available, such as the feature-rich Ant Design and Chakra UI, headless styles like Radix UI and Headless UI, as well as the popular shadcn/ui, among others. They are all highly regarded.

When developing personal projects and considering these options, I had some different ideas. Firstly, to reduce cognitive load; secondly, to have a certain stylistic uniqueness. As a result of these considerations, I decided to create my own UI library => LX-UI.

## What's next

- Improve the components and related documentation according to the specifications, ensuring usability and stability.
- Further expand the types of components and make some improvements based on Radix.
