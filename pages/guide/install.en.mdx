# Installation

This section will guide you on how to install `LX-UI` in your project and quickly get started.

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  LX-UI is currently developed based on React version 18. If you are using an
  older version of React, there may be some issues. It is recommended to upgrade
  to the latest version of React.
</Callout>

## Environment

- It is recommended to use pnpm for installation (although npm or yarn can also be used).

  ```bash copy
  npm i -g pnpm
  ```

- Installing Tailwind CSS

  Since LX-UI is based on Tailwind CSS, you need to install and configure Tailwind CSS in your project in order to use it properly. [Installation Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for instructions on how to install and configure it.

## Install LX-UI

<Tabs items={["pnpm", "npm", "yarn"]}>
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    pnpm add @ltopx/lx-ui
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    npm i @ltopx/lx-ui
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    yarn add @ltopx/lx-ui
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuring LX-UI

Since LX-UI is developed based on Tailwind CSS, you need to modify the `tailwind.config.js` file in your project and add the relevant configurations for LX-UI.

- Add presets for configuration
- Configure content path to resolve LX-UI components

```js filename="tailwind.config.js" copy {3-4}
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  presets: [require("@ltopx/lx-ui/dist/presets")],
  content: ["./node_modules/@ltopx/lx-ui/dist/**/*.{mjs,js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

## Usage

```js copy
import { Select } from "@ltopx/lx-ui";

export default function Home() {
  return <Select placeholder="Please select" options={[1, 2, 3]} />;
}
```
