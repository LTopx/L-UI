# Quick Start

## LX-UI

`LX-UI` is a set of React component library developed based on [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The purpose of creating this project is to solve the issue of UI consistency in my personal development project, [Le-AI](https://le-ai.app). The initial version may be relatively simple ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£, but it will gradually iterate and improve in the future.

## Features

- ðŸ”¥ Utilizes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for easy customization of styles.
